1787	Agreement for the supply of goods (non-retail)	Use this document to create an agreement for selling goods to another trade party. This document cannot be used by anyone selling to consumers (i.e. persons not acting in the ordinary course of business). The agreement covers such issues as time for payment, consequences of non payment, rights of cancellation, etc. so that the terms and conditions of this agreement are clear.	794	1	56	581	838	f	t
1788	Buyer's notice to end a contract	If you need to terminate a contract you have made with a seller of goods because the seller has breached any term which is fundamental to the contract, you can use this document to send notice to the seller that you are ending the contract. The breach must be so serious as to affect the very nature and performance of the contract itself. The document will allow you to seek compensation for your losses. In Scotland the term 'material' is used instead of 'fundamental', but both terms have the same meaning.	1014	1	56	581	838	f	t
1789	Circular letter introducing conditions of sale or purchase	When introducing new or replacement conditions of sale or purchase to a customer or supplier, you can use this document to create the necessary covering letter for the conditions of sale or purchase. This document creates two letters, one for the customer/supplier to keep, and one for them to sign and return to you acknowledging receipt. By acknowledging receipt, you will have evidence that they have received the conditions as if they do not receive these conditions, they will not be bound by them.	1015	1	56	581	838	f	t
1790	Distribution agreement	Use this document to create a distribution agreement whereby one business, typically a manufacturer, supplies goods to another for resale or onward supply. To use this document, the business supplying the goods must present the distributor with standard conditions of sale and a standard price list. The agreement will set out the obligations of the distributor and supplier and the terms under which they do business.	795	1	56	581	838	f	t
1791	Letter giving notice of termination of contract	Some contracts will contain an express clause allowing a party to bring the contract to an end by giving written notice. Normally the contract will continue to run for a limited period after the notice is given, eg. if the contract says 'terminable on 14 days' written notice', then a notice of termination given on 3 February 2008 will bring the contract to an end on 17 February 2008. This document enables you to draft such a letter. NOTE:This document is inappropriate for use in employment contract situations.	1013	1	56	581	838	f	t
1792	Notice of cancellation of order	Use this document to give notice of your cancellation of an order made for the supply of goods or services where cancellation is permitted under the terms of any applicable contract. This document can only be used where the applicable contract permits cancellation.	1026	1	56	581	838	f	t
1794	Sale of goods contract	This document records the sale of goods by a private individual (i.e. a person not acting in the ordinary course of business). The agreement will record the price of the goods and make a formal acknowledgement that either the moneys have been paid for the item, or that a deposit has been paid and acknowledge the amount still outstanding. It allows any warranties or guarantees to be entered, if applicable.	1016	1	56	581	838	f	t
1796	Terms and conditions for website selling consumer goods and/or services	This document creates standard terms and conditions for the sale of goods and/or services to consumers from a website in the United Kingdom.

1799	Assignment of the benefit of a contract	Use this document to assign the benefit (i.e. to transfer the benefit) of the rights you have under a contract. Most rights are capable of being assigned - for example, rights to benefits under insurance policies, rights to repayment of a loan, rights to purchase property and so on. However, it is important to note that you cannot assign any rights under a contract if the contract expressly prohibits that.	800	1	56	581	839	f	t
1786	Agency agreement	Businesses sometimes find it necessary to appoint agents in order to expand within the UK while maintaining control over the expansion. The agent will negotiate and secure contracts for the principal business in return for a commission. This document creates an agreement regulating such a situation. It also contains a clause to deal with the effect of the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations 1993, S 1 1993/3053 which is relevant if the agency is for goods rather than for services.	793	1	56	581	838	f	t
1793	Purchase order	This document is a purchase order with standard terms and conditions for the supply of goods. It has been drafted from the point of view of a purchaser of goods (as opposed to the seller) and is designed to protect the interests of the purchaser. The effect of a successful incorporation of these terms and conditions into any contract for the supply of goods would be that both purchaser and seller would be bound by the obligations set out.	796	1	56	581	838	f	t
1797	Assignment of beneficial interest in property	This document will allow the owner of a beneficial interest in property to transfer that interest to one or more people.

The person holding the property has a legal interest in the property; the person for whose benefit the property is held has a beneficial interest in the property.

This document is suitable for small to medium sized limited liability partnerships of no more than 20 members.

1806	Partnership agreement	This partnership agreement is in accordance with the Partnership Act 1890 and provides a contractual framework under which the partners should conduct themselves at all times.

1809	Codicil making an additional gift to an existing beneficiary	If you wish to make another gift of money or a specific item to a beneficiary named in your Will, you can use this codicil to do so without having to draft a new Will.

1825	Letter before action following earlier correspondence	Use this document to create a letter before taking action with respect to a claim that you have made. You should have previously sent a letter to the person you are making a claim against, detailing how the claim arose and what the effects have been, but had no response to your letter. Without sending this letter before taking action in court, the court may find that you have acted unreasonably, and may penalise you by disallowing or reducing the costs or interest that you might otherwise have been entitled to.

If the decision after the appeal hearing is not to dismiss, use our document Employee formal appeal hearing letter instead of this one.

This letter is the final step in the disciplinary process where the employee has previously been given at least two written warnings and has had previous meetings to discuss the matter and to give excuses and reasons. If, on the other hand, you are summarily dismissing on account of gross misconduct, you should use the 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct' document instead of this one.	882	1	59	584	\N	f	t
1920	Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct	In cases where an employer needs to immediately dismiss an employee on account of gross misconduct, this letter should be used.

1929	Statement of changes in terms of employment	This document will create a written statement confirming the changes made to an employment contract or statement of particulars. There are certain changes which, by law, must be confirmed in writing and others where it is not required; however, it is considered to be best practice to do so to protect the interests of both the employer and employee. The employee is required to sign this statement, confirming their consent to the change, to help protect the employer against a potential lawsuit.	891	1	59	580	844	f	t
1930	Work experience agreement	Work experience involves a placement in which a person carries out a range of tasks and duties, more or less as would an employee; however the emphasis is on the learning aspects of the experience and the person is not paid. Work experience is often undertaken in the summer before starting university, during university holidays or as part of a gap year. Please note: Due to additional regulatory requirements, this document is not suitable for use for students who are still at school, or who are under the mandatory school leaving age (16).	892	1	59	580	844	f	t
1921	Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct after an appeal hearing	This letter should be used when an employee has appealed a decision to dismiss on account of gross misconduct and the decision of the meeting is still to dismiss. At this appeal hearing the employee should have been given the opportunity to explain his/her conduct and why the disciplinary action taken should not have been implemented. Please note that if the employee has been successful in appealing against a dismissal, you should use our 'Employee formal appeal hearing letter' instead of this letter to formally notify the employee of the result of the appeal hearing. If the decision following this meeting is to dismiss but not on account of gross misconduct, you will have to use our document 'Employee dismissal letter after previous disciplinary action and an appeal hearing', rather than this one.	884	1	59	584	\N	f	t
1931	Agreement to opt out of the Working Time Directive	Employers should use this document to draft an agreement for their employees to formally opt out of the 48-hour working week under the Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended). This document cannot be used for workers who can chose freely how long they work (e.g. managing executives of a company), domestic servants in private households, workers in the armed forces, police and emergency services, trainee doctors and mobile workers in the transport industry (road, rail, air or sea).	893	1	59	582	845	f	t
1926	Employment agreement	Employers should use this employment agreement when taking on new members of staff. This agreement must be given to the employee within two months of starting. Failure to provide employees with a written statement of employment within two months is unlawful and could result in costly appearances before an employment tribunal.This agreement covers issues such as sick pay and incapacity, holiday entitlements, lay-offs, pension schemes, references, medical reports, company cars, restrictive covenants, disciplinary procedures, confidentiality, share option schemes, home working, teleworking and part-time working, among others. This agreement should be used in conjunction with an employee handbook containing more detailed HR and employment policies.	890	1	59	580	844	f	t
1928	Fixed-term employment agreement	Employers should use this fixed-term employment contract when they wish to take on an employee for a period which ends when either a specified date is reached, when a specified event has occurred or when a specified task has been completed.

The letter will inform them of the outcome of the meeting, which can include that no disciplinary action be taken, that your employee receive an oral warning, a written warning or a final written warning. If the decision following this meeting is to dismiss, you will have to use the 'Employee dismissal letter after previous disciplinary action and an appeal hearing' document, rather than this one. If the decision following this meeting is to summarily dismiss on account of their gross misconduct, you will have to use the 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct after an appeal hearing' document.	885	1	59	584	\N	f	t
1846	Privacy policy for a website	Use this document to create a privacy policy for your website. The purpose of such a policy is to stipulate the types of personal data that your website stores and how this information is used.

1924	Settlement agreement	If an employer and employee are in dispute then they may formally settle that dispute by entering into a legally binding contract called a compromise agreement. A compromise agreement can be used to settle any disputes which would otherwise have to be settled by the employment tribunal or county court. A compromise agreement will usually provide an employee with compensation. In return, the employee will agree not to pursue any legal claim that he or she may have against the employer (as well as agreeing to any further conditions that the employer may impose). This document is suitable for the UK.	877	1	59	584	\N	f	t
1940	Job offer letter	Use this document to create a suitable offer letter when making a job offer to a prospective employee. This offer letter should be a summary of the key parts of the full employment documents, i.e. an employment agreement or employment statement, which must be provided to an employee within two months of starting. The letter also requests the prospective employee to provide the correct documentation to prove their right to work in the UK prior to commencing their employment - to help protect you from liability.	896	1	59	580	\N	f	t
1935	Licence for an employee to occupy residential accommodation	This is a licence for an employee to occupy property owned by their employer on the basis that it is necessary for the employee to live in the property for the better performance of their duties. If this basis cannot be established then the employee will have a tenancy agreement and not a licence. If an employer has a lease for the property (usually associated with ownership of flats) or is renting the property from a third party, then it should check whether it requires permission from the landlord before granting this licence. Please note that this document is not suitable for use in Scotland.	895	1	59	582	845	f	t
1937	Fire risk review checklist	Use this document to complete the first stage of a fire risk assessment as is required under fire safety legislation. It will assist you to undertake a thorough inspection of the workplace and review of existing procedures. The purpose of this document is to gather information concerning potential fire risks, the risks to people within the workplace and the effectiveness of existing systems and procedures. After completing this first stage of the process, you should use our document 'Fire risk assessment - Recording of significant findings'.	898	1	59	582	846	f	t
1939	Risk assessment for young person on work experience	A risk assessment is a systematic method of looking at work activities, considering what could go wrong and deciding on suitable control measures to prevent loss, damage or injury in the workplace. Before a business takes on a young person under the age of 18 for work experience, the law requires them to undertake a health and safety risk assessment covering specific points. This easy-to-use form is designed for any business wishing to ensure that they meet their legal obligations in this regard and can be tailored to meet the needs of any industry or sector.	900	1	59	582	846	f	t
1933	Grievance appeal letter	If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a grievance meeting you can use this letter to request an appeal meeting.

Please note that this letter is only suitable for use where the grievance relates to an event which took place on or after 6 April 2009 and can only be used in England, Wales and Scotland only.	1598	1	59	584	845	f	t
1934	Grievance letter to employer	If you have a grievance about something which happened at your workplace, you can use this letter to raise your grievance with your employer. The letter allows you to state the details about your grievance and requests your employer to arrange a grievance meeting. You are also given an opportunity to request your employer to allow you to be accompanied if you want this. Please note that this document is only suitable for use in England, Wales and Scotland.	1599	1	59	584	845	f	t
1932	Employee handbook	Use this 'Employee handbook' to set out all the non-contractual issues relating to employment, including key administrative procedures. By doing so, and by complying with the policies and procedures set out within it, you will minimise the risk of potential employee lawsuits, such as discrimination, harassment and unfair dismissal and reduce the risk of having to appear before an Employment Tribunal, which can cost thousands of pounds. In addition to all the subjects which must be included in the handbook, such as maternity leave and grievance procedure, etc., there are also optional clauses which you may choose to include. These include clauses relating to company cars, dress code, alcohol and drug testing, bonus schemes and stress at work, amongst others. We recommend that this document should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it complies with future amendments to employment legislation.	894	1	59	582	845	f	t
1936	Fire risk assessment - record of significant findings	Use this document to complete the second and final stage of a fire risk assessment after using our document "Fire risk review checklist". On this document, you will record the sources of any significant risks of a fire occurring within your workplace and the risks to people within your workplace in the event of a fire. You will evaluate the severity of such risks and you will identify steps that might be taken to remove or reduce these risks. Finally, you will record what action is proposed to be taken and applicable timescales.	897	1	59	582	846	f	t
1798	Assignment of debt and notice	If you wish to assign the payment of a debt that is owed to you to another person (the assignee), you can use this document to do so. Once this debt has been assigned and the debtor has been notified of this assignment, the debtor will pay the debt to the assignee. This document will also create the required notice to the debtor, informing him/her that the debt has been assigned.	811	1	56	583	839	f	t
1795	Terms and conditions for the back of a goods order form	This document contains a set of terms and conditions that are suitable for someone who sells goods to other businesses. A large volume of sales business is done in reliance upon standard terms and conditions of sale. These are commonly found on the reverse side of a sellers invoice. It is very important to take the time to read the form in its entirety to ensure that it is appropriate for use in your individual situation. Please note that you cannot use this document if you are selling goods to consumers.	797	1	56	581	838	f	t
1800	Notice of assignment/assignation of the benefit of a contract	Use this document to create the notice required when a contract has been assigned. You must give notice to the other contracting party of the assignment. Without this notice, they are under no obligation to pay you (the person to whom the contract is assigned) and could continue to pay the person whom they first signed the contract with. You would not be able to claim any of the money.	1025	1	56	581	839	f	t
1844	Commission linking agreement for websites	Use this document to create an agreement whereby one website (the 'host') places a link on their website to an organisation which offers products for sale. The host site will be paid commission at the rate you specify in this agreement for each sale brought about through the link.	829	1	56	581	841	f	t
1848	Non-disclosure agreement	This document produces an agreement which allows one party (the discloser) to reveal to the other (the recipient) information which the discloser considers to be confidential. It is mainly designed for situations where the recipient is considering investing in the discloser and therefore needs to evaluate confidential information. In situations where there is a joint venture, where both parties need to protect their confidentiality, our "Mutual non-disclosure agreement" should be used instead. Please note that in order for this agreement to be enforceable in the UK, the discloser must be resident in the UK.	831	1	56	581	842	f	t
1925	Consultancy agreement	When a company engages the services of a consultant  whether a private individual or limited company  this document should be used to draw up the terms of the consultancy. Whilst it includes clauses covering remuneration, obligations and notice, it does not constitute a contract of employment. However, failure of either party to honour the terms of the agreement could lead to claims of breach of contract or negligence. The agreement also deals with the issue of copyright. Note that this document is not suitable for consultants working in the health and care industry or who would have contact with children or vulnerable adults.	887	1	59	580	844	f	t
1938	Health and safety compliance review and policy creator	This product enables you to prepare and document the compliance of your business with all relevant health and safety legislation. It does this by walking you through all the issues that you need to address - registration, insurance, risk analysis, risk minimisation, training, etc. The document then prepares a statement of development to be kept on file and shown to all interested parties and officials to prove that you have followed the appropriate procedures in developing a health and safety policy for your business. It also produces a list of actions with timelimits so that you address all relevant issues. Finally, it produces a tailored health and safety policy at the end of the document. Hence, this product produces three documents - a record of the development of your health and safety policy, a list of actions with timelimits and the health and safety policy itself.It is recommended that you review this policy every 18 months, or sooner if there are substantial changes to your staffing or premises.	899	1	59	582	846	f	t
1822	Acknowledgement of debt	When signed, this document will acknowledge the debt that is owed by one person to another, the reason why the debt arose and the amount owed. This serves two very important purposes:1. It makes it easier to prove the existence of a debt if it is later disputed. 2. It can interrupt or suspend the effect of:In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Limitation Act 1980 which causes a debt to become unenforceable after 6 years In Scotland, the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 which causes a debt to become unenforceable after 5 years in ScotlandIn the latter case, this document can have the effect of restarting the clock and making the limitation period start afresh, although it will not have this effect if the acknowledgement is made after the limitation period has already expired or if the acknowledgement is not made to the person to whom the debt is owed (or his/her agent).	822	1	56	583	847	f	t
1828	Promissory note in basic form	Use this document to generate a promissory note, which is a written promise that you  the maker - will pay a fixed sum of money to the payee either on demand or on the date specified in the note.

The employee is invited to attend the appeal meeting to reconsider or review the allegations made against the employee and/or the disciplinary action taken.	878	1	59	584	\N	f	t
1917	Employee disciplinary meeting outcome letter	Use this document to create a letter to notify your employee of the outcome of a disciplinary meeting. The decision can be that no disciplinary action be taken, or that an oral warning be given, or that a written warning or a final written warning be given. If the decision of the disciplinary meeting was to dismiss the employee following repeated disciplinary action, then you should use the Rapidocs document 'Employee dismissal letter following previous disciplinary action' rather than this document. If the decision is to summarily dismiss the employee on account of their gross misconduct, you should use the Rapidocs document 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct'.	880	1	59	584	\N	f	t

951	Buyer's notice to end a contract	t	f	56	581	838	If you need to terminate a contract you have made with a seller of goods because the seller has breached any term which is fundamental to the contract, you can use this document to send notice to the seller that you are ending the contract. The breach must be so serious as to affect the very nature and performance of the contract itself. The document will allow you to seek compensation for your losses. In Scotland the term 'material' is used instead of 'fundamental', but both terms have the same meaning.
952	Circular letter introducing conditions of sale or purchase	t	f	56	581	838	When introducing new or replacement conditions of sale or purchase to a customer or supplier, you can use this document to create the necessary covering letter for the conditions of sale or purchase. This document creates two letters, one for the customer/supplier to keep, and one for them to sign and return to you acknowledging receipt. By acknowledging receipt, you will have evidence that they have received the conditions as if they do not receive these conditions, they will not be bound by them.
953	Distribution agreement	t	f	56	581	838	Use this document to create a distribution agreement whereby one business, typically a manufacturer, supplies goods to another for resale or onward supply. To use this document, the business supplying the goods must present the distributor with standard conditions of sale and a standard price list. The agreement will set out the obligations of the distributor and supplier and the terms under which they do business.
954	Letter giving notice of termination of contract	t	f	56	581	838	Some contracts will contain an express clause allowing a party to bring the contract to an end by giving written notice. Normally the contract will continue to run for a limited period after the notice is given, eg. if the contract says 'terminable on 14 days' written notice', then a notice of termination given on 3 February 2008 will bring the contract to an end on 17 February 2008. This document enables you to draft such a letter. NOTE:This document is inappropriate for use in employment contract situations.
955	Notice of cancellation of order	t	f	56	581	838	Use this document to give notice of your cancellation of an order made for the supply of goods or services where cancellation is permitted under the terms of any applicable contract. This document can only be used where the applicable contract permits cancellation.
956	Purchase order	t	f	56	581	838	This document is a purchase order with standard terms and conditions for the supply of goods. It has been drafted from the point of view of a purchaser of goods (as opposed to the seller) and is designed to protect the interests of the purchaser. The effect of a successful incorporation of these terms and conditions into any contract for the supply of goods would be that both purchaser and seller would be bound by the obligations set out.
957	Sale of goods contract	t	f	56	581	838	This document records the sale of goods by a private individual (i.e. a person not acting in the ordinary course of business). The agreement will record the price of the goods and make a formal acknowledgement that either the moneys have been paid for the item, or that a deposit has been paid and acknowledge the amount still outstanding. It allows any warranties or guarantees to be entered, if applicable.
958	Terms and conditions for the back of a goods order form	t	f	56	581	838	This document contains a set of terms and conditions that are suitable for someone who sells goods to other businesses. A large volume of sales business is done in reliance upon standard terms and conditions of sale. These are commonly found on the reverse side of a sellers invoice. It is very important to take the time to read the form in its entirety to ensure that it is appropriate for use in your individual situation. Please note that you cannot use this document if you are selling goods to consumers.
959	Terms and conditions for website selling consumer goods and/or services	t	f	56	581	838	This document creates standard terms and conditions for the sale of goods and/or services to consumers from a website in the United Kingdom.

To administer the estate, those who are entitled must apply for 'letters of administration'. If you are entitled to make such an application, but you do not wish to be involved in the administration of the estate, you can use this document to renounce this right. Note that by renouncing your right to a grant, you will NOT affect any entitlement you may have to benefit from the estate; you are merely declining to become involved in the administration.

At this appeal hearing the employee should have been given the opportunity to explain his/her conduct and why the disciplinary action taken should not have been implemented. Please note that if the employee has been successful in appealing against a dismissal, you should use our 'Employee formal appeal hearing letter' instead of this letter to formally notify the employee of the result of the appeal hearing. If the decision following this meeting is to dismiss but not on account of gross misconduct, you will have to use our document 'Employee dismissal letter after previous disciplinary action and an appeal hearing', rather than this one.

1054	Letter of wishes	f	t	57	574	\N	A letter of wishes is an informal letter addressed to your executors which expresses what you would like to happen following your death.

It does not interfere with or restrict the discretion of the executors in any way.
1056	Mirror Wills for married couples or civil partners	f	t	57	574	\N	This document creates two Wills for either a married couple or for two people in a civil partnership with each other. The Wills can be created as Mirror Wills or as Mutual Wills. Mirror Wills are Wills made by two people in substantially the same terms. In these Wills, the married couple/the civil partners provide for each other on the first death, and then say what is to happen on the event of the second death, which is the same in both Wills.Mutual Wills are Mirror Wills, but with one crucial additional feature, which is that Mutual Wills are based on an agreement that neither of the people making the Mutual Wills may later cancel or change their Will without the consent of the other person. These Wills are suitable for use in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
1055	Living Will	f	t	57	575	\N	Use this document to create a 'Living Will', which is a document that sets out your wishes regarding health care and how you want to be treated if you become seriously ill and unable to make or communicate your own choices. Your wishes can be either that certain treatment should not be provided in specified circumstances (and these wishes can be binding on medical staff), or that you should be treated or cared for in a particular way (these wishes are not binding on medical staff but should be taken into account).
1084	Employee disciplinary appeal hearing letter	t	f	59	584	\N	This document creates a letter to an employee asking him or her to attend a formal disciplinary appeal meeting after the employee has appealed a decision taken at a disciplinary meeting to take disciplinary action against him or her. It is designed for general use. The employee is invited to attend the appeal meeting to reconsider or review the allegations made against the employee and/or the disciplinary action taken.
1057	Revocation of a Living Will	f	t	57	575	\N	This is a formal, written revocation of a Living Will. It would be appropriate where the directions given and the views expressed in a Living Will no longer reflect the maker's wishes, and the maker does not wish to substitute a new Living Will. If it is desired to substitute a new Living Will in place of the old, the Living Will precedent should be used instead, as it contains a clause revoking any previous Living Wills.
1085	Employee disciplinary meeting letter	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this document to create a letter to an employee asking them to attend a formal disciplinary meeting. The letter is designed for general use. At the meeting the employee will be able to explain his or her conduct. After the meeting you should formally notify the employee of the decision that was made.
1086	Employee disciplinary meeting outcome letter	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this document to create a letter to notify your employee of the outcome of a disciplinary meeting. The decision can be that no disciplinary action be taken, or that an oral warning be given, or that a written warning or a final written warning be given. If the decision of the disciplinary meeting was to dismiss the employee following repeated disciplinary action, then you should use the Rapidocs document 'Employee dismissal letter following previous disciplinary action' rather than this document. If the decision is to summarily dismiss the employee on account of their gross misconduct, you should use the Rapidocs document 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct'.
1088	Employee dismissal letter following previous disciplinary action	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this document to create a dismissal letter to an employee following previous disciplinary action and a final disciplinary meeting. This letter is the final step in the disciplinary process where the employee has previously been given at least two written warnings and has had previous meetings to discuss the matter and to give excuses and reasons. If, on the other hand, you are summarily dismissing on account of gross misconduct, you should use the 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct' document instead of this one.
1091	Employee formal appeal hearing outcome letter	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this document to send a letter to your employee following a formal appeal hearing. The letter will inform them of the outcome of the meeting, which can include that no disciplinary action be taken, that your employee receive an oral warning, a written warning or a final written warning. If the decision following this meeting is to dismiss, you will have to use the 'Employee dismissal letter after previous disciplinary action and an appeal hearing' document, rather than this one. If the decision following this meeting is to summarily dismiss on account of their gross misconduct, you will have to use the 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct after an appeal hearing' document.
1092	Employee suspension letter pending investigations of allegations	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this letter to formally suspend an employee while you conduct an investigation into allegations made against him or her. It is designed to temporarily remove an employee from his or her post when that employee's continued presence in the workplace may involve risk, danger or embarrassment or may be prejudicial to good discipline. Note that suspension is not a punishment and, as such, there should be no loss of normal pay or pension entitlement.
1093	Settlement agreement	t	f	59	584	\N	If an employer and employee are in dispute then they may formally settle that dispute by entering into a legally binding contract called a compromise agreement. A compromise agreement can be used to settle any disputes which would otherwise have to be settled by the employment tribunal or county court. A compromise agreement will usually provide an employee with compensation. In return, the employee will agree not to pursue any legal claim that he or she may have against the employer (as well as agreeing to any further conditions that the employer may impose). This document is suitable for the UK.
1096	Employment statement	t	f	59	580	844	This document prepares a set of standard terms and conditions of employment. It is designed for use by employers who wish to have a very simple employment contract in place. By law, all employees must receive written particulars of the terms of their employment within two calendar months. It is recommended that you use this employment statement in combination with an employee handbook.
1097	Fixed-term employment agreement	t	f	59	580	844	Employers should use this fixed-term employment contract when they wish to take on an employee for a period which ends when either a specified date is reached, when a specified event has occurred or when a specified task has been completed. The agreement must be provided to the employee within two months of their start date. The agreement deals with the job description and other related matters such as holiday entitlement, salary, sickness, inventions, disciplinary procedures and confidentiality.
1098	Statement of changes in terms of employment	t	f	59	580	844	This document will create a written statement confirming the changes made to an employment contract or statement of particulars. There are certain changes which, by law, must be confirmed in writing and others where it is not required; however, it is considered to be best practice to do so to protect the interests of both the employer and employee. The employee is required to sign this statement, confirming their consent to the change, to help protect the employer against a potential lawsuit.
1099	Work experience agreement	t	f	59	580	844	Work experience involves a placement in which a person carries out a range of tasks and duties, more or less as would an employee; however the emphasis is on the learning aspects of the experience and the person is not paid. Work experience is often undertaken in the summer before starting university, during university holidays or as part of a gap year. Please note: Due to additional regulatory requirements, this document is not suitable for use for students who are still at school, or who are under the mandatory school leaving age (16).
1103	Grievance letter to employer	t	f	59	584	845	If you have a grievance about something which happened at your workplace, you can use this letter to raise your grievance with your employer. The letter allows you to state the details about your grievance and requests your employer to arrange a grievance meeting. You are also given an opportunity to request your employer to allow you to be accompanied if you want this. Please note that this document is only suitable for use in England, Wales and Scotland.
1095	Employment agreement	t	f	59	580	844	Employers should use this employment agreement when taking on new members of staff. This agreement must be given to the employee within two months of starting. Failure to provide employees with a written statement of employment within two months is unlawful and could result in costly appearances before an employment tribunal.This agreement covers issues such as sick pay and incapacity, holiday entitlements, lay-offs, pension schemes, references, medical reports, company cars, restrictive covenants, disciplinary procedures, confidentiality, share option schemes, home working, teleworking and part-time working, among others. This agreement should be used in conjunction with an employee handbook containing more detailed HR and employment policies.
1101	Employee handbook	t	f	59	582	845	Use this 'Employee handbook' to set out all the non-contractual issues relating to employment, including key administrative procedures. By doing so, and by complying with the policies and procedures set out within it, you will minimise the risk of potential employee lawsuits, such as discrimination, harassment and unfair dismissal and reduce the risk of having to appear before an Employment Tribunal, which can cost thousands of pounds. In addition to all the subjects which must be included in the handbook, such as maternity leave and grievance procedure, etc., there are also optional clauses which you may choose to include. These include clauses relating to company cars, dress code, alcohol and drug testing, bonus schemes and stress at work, amongst others. We recommend that this document should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that it complies with future amendments to employment legislation.
1104	Licence for an employee to occupy residential accommodation	t	f	59	582	845	This is a licence for an employee to occupy property owned by their employer on the basis that it is necessary for the employee to live in the property for the better performance of their duties. If this basis cannot be established then the employee will have a tenancy agreement and not a licence. If an employer has a lease for the property (usually associated with ownership of flats) or is renting the property from a third party, then it should check whether it requires permission from the landlord before granting this licence. Please note that this document is not suitable for use in Scotland.
1105	Fire risk assessment - record of significant findings	t	f	59	582	846	Use this document to complete the second and final stage of a fire risk assessment after using our document "Fire risk review checklist". On this document, you will record the sources of any significant risks of a fire occurring within your workplace and the risks to people within your workplace in the event of a fire. You will evaluate the severity of such risks and you will identify steps that might be taken to remove or reduce these risks. Finally, you will record what action is proposed to be taken and applicable timescales.
1102	Grievance appeal letter	t	f	59	584	845	If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a grievance meeting you can use this letter to request an appeal meeting. The letter allows you to set out the grounds of your appeal and requests that your appeal meeting be dealt with by a different manager than the one who originally dealt with your grievance meeting. Please note that this letter is only suitable for use where the grievance relates to an event which took place on or after 6 April 2009 and can only be used in England, Wales and Scotland only.
1100	Agreement to opt out of the Working Time Directive	t	f	59	582	845	Employers should use this document to draft an agreement for their employees to formally opt out of the 48-hour working week under the Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended). This document cannot be used for workers who can chose freely how long they work (e.g. managing executives of a company), domestic servants in private households, workers in the armed forces, police and emergency services, trainee doctors and mobile workers in the transport industry (road, rail, air or sea).
1109	Job offer letter	t	f	59	580	\N	Use this document to create a suitable offer letter when making a job offer to a prospective employee. This offer letter should be a summary of the key parts of the full employment documents, i.e. an employment agreement or employment statement, which must be provided to an employee within two months of starting. The letter also requests the prospective employee to provide the correct documentation to prove their right to work in the UK prior to commencing their employment - to help protect you from liability.
949	Agency agreement	t	f	56	581	838	Businesses sometimes find it necessary to appoint agents in order to expand within the UK while maintaining control over the expansion. The agent will negotiate and secure contracts for the principal business in return for a commission. This document creates an agreement regulating such a situation. It also contains a clause to deal with the effect of the Commercial Agents (Council Directive) Regulations 1993, S 1 1993/3053 which is relevant if the agency is for goods rather than for services.
963	Notice of assignment/assignation of the benefit of a contract	t	f	56	581	839	Use this document to create the notice required when a contract has been assigned. You must give notice to the other contracting party of the assignment. Without this notice, they are under no obligation to pay you (the person to whom the contract is assigned) and could continue to pay the person whom they first signed the contract with. You would not be able to claim any of the money.
1007	Commission linking agreement for websites	t	f	56	581	841	Use this document to create an agreement whereby one website (the 'host') places a link on their website to an organisation which offers products for sale. The host site will be paid commission at the rate you specify in this agreement for each sale brought about through the link.
1008	Domain name transfer agreement	t	f	56	581	841	A domain name is property and capable of ownership - it may be bought and sold - and this agreement records the sale of a domain name from one person or business to another. Currently in the UK there are no formal requirements for domain name sales or transfers to be evidenced in writing. Nevertheless, it is sensible to have a written agreement so that appropriate warranties and assurances are given.
1011	Non-disclosure agreement	t	f	56	581	842	This document produces an agreement which allows one party (the discloser) to reveal to the other (the recipient) information which the discloser considers to be confidential. It is mainly designed for situations where the recipient is considering investing in the discloser and therefore needs to evaluate confidential information. In situations where there is a joint venture, where both parties need to protect their confidentiality, our "Mutual non-disclosure agreement" should be used instead. Please note that in order for this agreement to be enforceable in the UK, the discloser must be resident in the UK.
1094	Consultancy agreement	t	f	59	580	844	When a company engages the services of a consultant  whether a private individual or limited company  this document should be used to draw up the terms of the consultancy. Whilst it includes clauses covering remuneration, obligations and notice, it does not constitute a contract of employment. However, failure of either party to honour the terms of the agreement could lead to claims of breach of contract or negligence. The agreement also deals with the issue of copyright. Note that this document is not suitable for consultants working in the health and care industry or who would have contact with children or vulnerable adults.
1107	Health and safety compliance review and policy creator	t	f	59	582	846	This product enables you to prepare and document the compliance of your business with all relevant health and safety legislation. It does this by walking you through all the issues that you need to address - registration, insurance, risk analysis, risk minimisation, training, etc. The document then prepares a statement of development to be kept on file and shown to all interested parties and officials to prove that you have followed the appropriate procedures in developing a health and safety policy for your business. It also produces a list of actions with timelimits so that you address all relevant issues. Finally, it produces a tailored health and safety policy at the end of the document. Hence, this product produces three documents - a record of the development of your health and safety policy, a list of actions with timelimits and the health and safety policy itself.It is recommended that you review this policy every 18 months, or sooner if there are substantial changes to your staffing or premises.
1108	Risk assessment for young person on work experience	t	f	59	582	846	A risk assessment is a systematic method of looking at work activities, considering what could go wrong and deciding on suitable control measures to prevent loss, damage or injury in the workplace. Before a business takes on a young person under the age of 18 for work experience, the law requires them to undertake a health and safety risk assessment covering specific points. This easy-to-use form is designed for any business wishing to ensure that they meet their legal obligations in this regard and can be tailored to meet the needs of any industry or sector.
1106	Fire risk review checklist	t	f	59	582	846	Use this document to complete the first stage of a fire risk assessment as is required under fire safety legislation. It will assist you to undertake a thorough inspection of the workplace and review of existing procedures. The purpose of this document is to gather information concerning potential fire risks, the risks to people within the workplace and the effectiveness of existing systems and procedures. After completing this first stage of the process, you should use our document 'Fire risk assessment - Recording of significant findings'.
985	Acknowledgement of debt	t	f	56	583	847	When signed, this document will acknowledge the debt that is owed by one person to another, the reason why the debt arose and the amount owed. This serves two very important purposes:1. It makes it easier to prove the existence of a debt if it is later disputed. 2. It can interrupt or suspend the effect of:In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the Limitation Act 1980 which causes a debt to become unenforceable after 6 years In Scotland, the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973 which causes a debt to become unenforceable after 5 years in ScotlandIn the latter case, this document can have the effect of restarting the clock and making the limitation period start afresh, although it will not have this effect if the acknowledgement is made after the limitation period has already expired or if the acknowledgement is not made to the person to whom the debt is owed (or his/her agent).
1087	Employee dismissal letter after previous disciplinary action and an appeal hearing	t	f	59	584	\N	Use this letter to dismiss an employee after he/she has appealed a decision to dismiss made at a disciplinary meeting, but the decision following the appeal hearing is still to dismiss. If the decision after the appeal hearing is not to dismiss, use our document Employee formal appeal hearing letter instead of this one. If the decision following this meeting is to summarily dismiss on account of their gross misconduct, you will have to use our document 'Employee dismissal letter for gross misconduct after an appeal hearing'. Please note that in order to use this letter, the employee must have been the subject of repeated disciplinary action due to their poor performance and/or professional misconduct and must have been dismissed using a valid disciplinary and dismissal procedure.
