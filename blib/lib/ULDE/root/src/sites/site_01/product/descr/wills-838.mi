		<h2>Revocation of a Living Will</h2>
		<p>This is a formal, written revocation of a Living Will. It would be appropriate where the directions given and the views expressed in a Living Will no longer reflect the maker's wishes, and the maker does not wish to substitute a new Living Will.
		<p class="odd">If it is desired to substitute a new Living Will in place of the old, the Living Will precedent should be used instead, as it contains a clause revoking any previous Living Wills.</p>
