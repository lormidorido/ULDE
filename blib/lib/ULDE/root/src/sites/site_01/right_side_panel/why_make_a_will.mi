        <h6>Why make a Will?</h6>
        <div class="howitworks">
            <p>If you donâ€™t have a legal Will, you will not be in control of who receives your assets (money, property, jewellery and so on). They may not go to who you would logically expect. They could even go to the person you least want to have them, such as an ex-spouse, or even the taxman!  Having a legal Will is the only way to ensure that your instructions and wishes will be carried out in the event of your death. </p>
